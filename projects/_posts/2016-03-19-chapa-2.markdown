The elections for a new presidency were about to start on the Council of Architecture and Urbanism. My job was to create a website to promote one of the group of candidates running the election. My idea was to create a clean site, straight to the point, and that the user could easily find the main ideas of these candidates and their proposals.

### Techs Used
In this project Wordpress was chosen as the CMS. The time of execution was very short so we jumped into one of the most beautiful pre-made theme for Wordpress on the market at that time, named [Agile](http://themeforest.net/item/agile-multipurpose-app-showcase-wordpress-theme/6631729). The one-page structure of this theme and the easy customization made the website a great success.
