This app named "Corrida do Food Truck" was made to promote a new TV show on the GNT channel. Me and my team had the idea to build a small race game where the user was in control of a foodtruck car. Depending on the score made inside the run, the user had the ability to customize his food truck and was able to share his car with his friends on Facebook or Twitter.

### Techs Used
HTML5, CSS3, JS and PHP to store the scores

Race framework utilized:
