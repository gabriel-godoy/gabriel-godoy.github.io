The company Azul Seguros needed to modernize its intranet. The intranet of the company is mainly used to manage internal communication directly to their employees. Together with the creation of the intranet, a research was needed to plan which areas would need a content management system, so the update could be done by them after delivery.

### Techs used
The place where I was working chose to use Wordpress to manage the content of the new intranet. An exclusive theme was built, together with *custom widgets* and *plugins* to fill all the client needs. The utilization of custom post types and custom fields was a must also specially because of their diverse and dynamic content.
