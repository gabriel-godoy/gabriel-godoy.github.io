The TV show "Fazendo a Festa" was about to premiere on the GNT channel, and the GNT team needed an app where the user could interact with the content and that was valuable. The idea here was to make a calculator that could tell how many drinks and food you would have to buy for a children party based on the user input about how many adults and children were invited.
